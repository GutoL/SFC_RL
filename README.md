# RL for SFC placement

This repository contains the notebook which has a solution using reinforcement learning (RL) for SFC placement. A simulator was developed using python to simulate the arrival of SFC requests and eventual failures/repair events of the infrastructure components. The environment was developed using the openAI gym framework. The library stable baselines was used to develp the RL agents.
